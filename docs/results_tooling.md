## Tooling-level measurements (hand-maintained)

This file is appended verbatim to `docs/results.md` by
`bench results` / `render_results_doc` — edit it here, never in the
generated file.  These measurements live in `tools/` and are
recorded in the retros, not in `bench/baselines/`.

All measured on the dev box (RTX 2050 / i5-12500H, fp64 — same
hardware class as the baselines); magnitudes do not extrapolate to
datacenter hardware:

| measurement | result | tool | retro |
|---|---|---|---|
| `softmax_fold` on `ManualSoftmaxAttention` | **+13–27% eager, +29–48% CUDA-graph** vs raw | `tools/law_wallclock.py` | [law-wallclock-verification](../project/retros/law-wallclock-verification.md) |
| `select_mul` marginal (optimized vs law-ablated) | **faster in 19/20 measurements** | `tools/law_wallclock.py` | [law-wallclock-verification](../project/retros/law-wallclock-verification.md) |
| executor routing after measured pricing | **12/12 cases ship the measured-fastest member** (uncorrected picks ran 2–3× slower) | `tools/executor_cost_probe.py` | [executor-pricing-fix](../project/retros/executor-pricing-fix.md) |
| `silu_fold` on the bench case | **−53–55% modeled cost, 1.43–2.62× wall-clock** | `bench run law_bench` | [three-cell-mediator](../project/retros/three-cell-mediator.md) |
| contraction player, n=40 vs `opt_einsum` | **0.89–1.01× of randomised greedy at equal wall-clock** (0.91–0.98 at T≤1, three seeds, fed budgets); **0.51–0.90× deterministic greedy** | `tools/contraction_guided_restart.py` | [contraction-synthesis](../project/retros/contraction-synthesis.md), [contraction-player-shipped](../project/retros/contraction-player-shipped.md) |
| pipeline held-out rediscovery | **winner re-ranks #1, SHIP, every run** | `catopt_discovery.pipeline --holdout` | [law-proposer-extensions](../project/retros/law-proposer-extensions.md), [groupnorm-convnext-corpus](../project/retros/groupnorm-convnext-corpus.md) |
| coherence catalogue over `ALL_RULES` (54) | **40 axioms / 12 lemmas / 2 redundant; divergence 0** | `catopt_discovery.coherence --emit-basis` | [axiom-lemma-split](../project/retros/axiom-lemma-split.md) |
| evidence store, second run | **50/50 verdicts cached; 128 s → 6.6 s (~19×)** | `catopt_discovery.pipeline --evidence-db` | [evidence-store](../project/retros/evidence-store.md) |

Two reconciliation notes:

- **The contraction "~1.8×" claim is stale.**  Early numbers had
  the learned policy at 1.54–1.78× of `opt_einsum`'s randomised
  greedy at n=40; the RL curriculum regime narrowed the gap to
  ~1.04×, and the oe-all **distilled** player that now ships as
  `catopt_torch.load_contraction_policy()`'s default *beats* the
  teacher at equal wall-clock (the figure in the table above).  The
  curriculum-RL weights remain bundled as an alternate artifact.
- **The `bounded_e2e` baseline's headline is vs eager** (best
  1.322×, above).  Its per-cell `speedup_vs_inductor` spans
  0.94–1.25 (1.16–1.25 over the budgets that delivered a bounded
  member) — so the README's "1.15–1.32× vs Inductor" is not the
  pinned baseline's literal column: the 1.32 is vs eager and the
  vs-Inductor delivered range tops out at 1.25 on this baseline.
